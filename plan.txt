Before getting started, you and your partner should spend some time brainstorming a plan for your restaurant page. Use this page to take notes and outline the content you will display on your page. 

At minumum, your page should include:
- An HTML shell (doctype, html, head, title, body tags)
- At least two header elements (h1, h3, etc.)
- At least one image
- At least one paragraph element
- At least one anchor (a) element linking to another page

A rough template has been put together to help you get started, but feel free to update and make as many changes as you like.
