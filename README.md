# HTML Restaurant Page

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/upperlinecode/html-restaurant-page)](https://repl.it/github/upperlinecode/html-restaurant-page)

## Instructions:
1. When you get to your breakout room, **have the partner whose birthday is soonest click the remix button**. You'll be the project owner. Once your remix loads (you may need to refresh) share that link with your partner in chat.
2. **Then the other partner (we'll call you the collaborator) should click "request to join project"** - after that the project owner can accept that request and let you join. 
3. Go to the file on the left called "plan.txt" and together with your partner, start to **make a plan for the restaurant you plan to create.** 
4. You'll probably be called back before you can finish, but as long as you finish at least section 1, you'll be ready to move on with the lesson when breakout rooms are over. If you do finish your plan, try adding another menu item or two.
