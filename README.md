# HTML Restaurant Page

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/upperlinecode/html-restaurant-page)](https://repl.it/github/upperlinecode/html-restaurant-page)

## CONTEXT & PURPOSE

Up to this point you have learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. It's time to put those newly found skills to use. You and your partner will have time to plan and build your very own website using HTML and CSS. We've suggested a restaurant page, but it doesn't have to be that. If you have any other business ideas that you are excited about you are welcome to build a site around that as well. We just care that you exercise your creativity and use the knowledge you've acquired to build a static website. There are a few guidelines to get started, and once you've met the minimum requirements for this project we encourage you to add anything else you want to bring to life the page you envision. 

## <a href="getting-started"></a>GETTING STARTED

### Launch
Before getting started, check out a  <a href="https://upperlinecode.github.io/cssi_102/day1/day1_final/index.html">finished example</a> to get an idea of what you'll be aiming to build.  Here's a <a href="https://petes-pizza-unstyled.glitch.me">un-styled version</a> to give you a sense of what you site will look like before you add any CSS. 


### Planning
Before diving into any code, it is always a good idea to start with a plan. Spend a few minutes with your partner brainstorming how you want to design your project. Use the `plan.txt` file to outline your page and draft the details of the content you'll include. Here are some key things you'll want to consider:

* The type of cuisine (or business if you decide to build something other than a restaurant)
* What you'll name your restaurant
* Where it will be located, and contact info
* Menu items
* Motto or mission statement
* Theme or mood of your restaurant, and how you want to style the page

In addition to thinking about *what* you want to include on your page, you should also think about *how* you want to organize it. You are encouraged to group each piece of content in divs to segment your page. Giving each div an ID will help you keep your styling organized later on. 

### Setup
To get set up, open the template in Repl.it or fork and clone the Github <a href="https://github.com/upperlinecode/html-restaurant-page">template repository</a> to make your own working copy. 

You and your partner will practice driver-navigator style pair programming to work on this project. Be sure to switch roles at least once as you work. 

### Requirements
At minimum, your website must include the following:
* Skeleton HTML (doctype, html, head, title, body)
* At least two header elements (h1, h3, etc.)
* At least one image
* At least one paragraph
* At least one anchor (a) element linking to another page

You are encouraged to search documentation if you need help with syntax or finding a particular element. Feel free to reference the HTML elements in the <a href="https://github.com/upperlinecode/html-css-js-reference" target="_blank_">student-facing reference</a>. The section labeled "auxiliary HTML" is useful as a series of extensions. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3Schools</a> is another excellent resource for HTML and CSS documentation.

## SAVE THIS PROJECT

After lunch, you will have a chance to style this exact page.
